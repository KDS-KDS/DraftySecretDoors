# DraftySecretDoors
Daggerfall Unity Mod - Regular secret doors emit a faint wind sound, making it easier to find them without resorting to madly clicking on every wall or eyeballing your automap for suspicious doors.

Only works on doors you can click to open. May not work for doors that open via lever.
