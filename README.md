# DraftySecretDoors
Daggerfall Unity Mod - Regular secret doors emit a faint wind sound, making it easier to find them without resorting to madly clicking on every wall or eyeballing your automap for suspicious doors.

First release may not account for all doors. But it should. Please report any bugs!

To Install: Drop the draftysecretdoors.dfmod into your Daggerfall Unity\Daggerfall Unity_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods folder. It's a breeze!
